# Text2Image_Thesis

This is the code of my thesis which uses the algorithm of CLS-GAN and StackGAN found at:https://github.com/hellochick/text-to-image		
I have also added the implemantation of IS and FID from:https://github.com/tsc2017/Frechet-Inception-Distance,
https://github.com/tsc2017/Inception-Score having made some adjustments to the code
I also have added some more code of my own for image slicing and storing in files

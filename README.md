# Prepare Data
Download image files and captions from Google Drive, put into ./text-to-image directory


# Evaluation Metrics
I have also added the implemantation of IS and FID from:https://github.com/tsc2017/Frechet-Inception-Distance,
https://github.com/tsc2017/Inception-Score having made some adjustments to the code


# Slice images & store
I also have added some more code of my own for image slicing and storing in files

# Sample image(21  epochs)

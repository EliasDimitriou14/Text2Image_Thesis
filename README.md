I have also added the implemantation of IS and FID from:https://github.com/tsc2017/Frechet-Inception-Distance,
https://github.com/tsc2017/Inception-Score having made some adjustments to the code

I also have added some more code of my own for image slicing and storing in files

This repository contains ONLY the code of the thesis.The rest of the useful files for execution can be found at the links above!!!
